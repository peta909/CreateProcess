# CreateProcess() and WaitForSingleObject ()
A simple C++ Program to show how to use CreateProcess() is used to create and execute a process with and without arguments.
Then used WaitForSingleObject() to check if the process has terminated.

# Kernel Debugging
Using Kernel Debugger we could track the "life" of the EProcess struct of the child process.
The EProcess struct of a process is only removed when all handles to the process is closed.

# FYI
The code was written and compiled using VS2017 Professional.
